  In this work, we introduce a neural image compression-enabled semantic communication system to enhance the efficiency of digital image transmission, named NCSC. By employing an accurate and adaptable entropy model, NCSC obtains the efficiently compressed bitstreams, which are compatible with digital communication systems. Incorporating with the well-established digital components, our system trained on the MS-SSIM metric can achieve a significant bandwidth compression ratio of 0.002 at low SNR, reducing remarkably transmission overhead.
